    Lore - 
        Was actually another Crew member with a loader exsosuit aboard the contact light however his escape pod crash 
        took off his Exosuit arm, and badly injured his own arm, because he wasn't confident in his survival skills without 
        the suit fully functional he instead hid himself away avoiding conflict unless nesscasary that was until he saw the 
        Contact light Take flight off the planet, leaving him behind. With that he felt abandoned but didnt give up hope, 
        instead surviving on the planet by picking his fights carefully and scavenging what was left from the contact light,
        fashioning a piece of scrap into a weapon and stealing from the inhabitants of Petrichor V. 
        This is until the UES shows up where he realizes there is a new shot at getting off of the planet.

            -"What did you want to see me about"
            .
            "Damm Doc I don't know......"
            "It's something I havent really though about it since I joined onto the Contact Light you know?"
            "But if I had to say anything, I guess im feeling regrets about my life. see always wanted to be a Fencer, and compete in those
            old competitions, Hell I even got Training lessons, but uh....It didn't really work out"
            .
            -"My that is a tough thing to deal with, especially with your posistion in the company, what made you want to dream
            of such a career in the first place?"
            .
            "Is that even really important doc?"
            .
            -"That is up to you, I just want to make sure you are hapy here aboard the contact light, and talking like this certainly
            helps the others, but if you don't want to talk about it you don't have to.
            .
            "........Fine, but don't end up calling me a sissy or nothin got it."
            .
            -"This is a safe space, I wouldnt dream of such a thing."
            .
            "Sure whatever you say Doc."
            "I guess I wanted to become a fencer when watching some old tapes with my Ma, the way they moved, so gracefully and 
            carefully, then they went in for the kill so fluidly, It was beautiful yknow... wished I could be like that someday.
            I always watched the videos wishing I could move around like that, but even at those practice classes I was never 
            really that good, always beaten out by those more talented or dedicated, but still it was fun for a hobby I guess"
            .
            -"Was that class a fond memory of yours?"
            .
            "Heh, yeah it was a nice time, but the more I grew up the more muscle I put on, and the less viable it became for a job, 
            so I settled down here I guess."
            .
            -"From what I hear there are still a handful of private competitions on Earth, we could give you some vacation time and you could
            apply try it out once more?"
            .
            "Heh... I appriciate the offer, I really do, but just talking to you here has made me feel a whole lot better about it."
            . 
            "I do kinda regret not becoming a fencer but I think i've come to terms that it was never more than just a Dream"
            .
            .
            .
            "Just a stupid dream."
