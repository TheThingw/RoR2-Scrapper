**Primary** Thrust
 - Stab forward for 240% damage. On kill Impale forward for 500% damage. the 4th hit grants a stack of **Opportunist**
    (4 looping attack animations)
    (Impale is like a level 1 Mercenary utility dash)
    (Could make Impale on its own not kill enemies, that way you can impale chain multiple enemies? but idk if thats better for balance)
    (The first part of this works almost identically to "Pathfider's" secondary skill)

 - 4/s Cooldown - Sidestep and gain a stack of **Opportunist**. then Lunge forward towards your crosshair for 450%. On kill Impale forward for 500% damage.

    Lore - 
        Was actually another Crew member with a loader exsosuit aboard the contact light however his escape pod crash 
        took off his Exosuit arm, and badly injured his own arm, because he wasn't confident in his survival skills without 
        the suit fully functional he instead hid himself away avoiding conflict unless nesscasary that was until he saw the 
        Contact light Take flight off the planet, leaving him behind. With that he felt abandoned but didnt give up hope, 
        instead surviving on the planet by picking his fights carefully and scavenging what was left from the contact light,
        fashioning a piece of scrap into a weapon and stealing from the inhabitants of Petrichor V. 
        This is until the UES shows up where he realizes there is a new shot at getting off of the planet.

            -"Would you like to pick up where we last left off?"
            .
            "Damm Doc I don't know......"
            .
            -"I wont pressure you into talking, but our last session was really productive"
            .
            "It's something I havent really though about since I joined onto the Contact Light you know?"
            "But if I had to say anything, I guess im feeling some regrets about my life. see always wanted to be a Fencer, and compete in those
            old competitions, Hell I even got Training lessons, but uh....It didn't really work out"
            .
            -"Regrets are natural, everyone has them but im suprised, especially with your posistion in the company, what made you want to dream
            of such a career in the first place?"
            .
            "Is that even really important doc?"
            .
            -"That is up to you, I just want to make sure you are happy during this voyage, and talking like this certainly
            helps the others, but if you don't want to talk about it you don't have to.
            .
            "........Fine, but don't end up calling me a sissy or nothin got it."
            .
            -"I wouldnt dream of such a thing."
            .
            "Sure, whatever you say Doc."
            "I guess I wanted to become a fencer when watching some old tapes with my Ma, the way they moved, so gracefull, then they went in for 
             the kill so fluidly, It was beautiful to watch yknow... wished I could be like that someday.
            I always watched the videos wishing I could move around like that, but even at those practice classes I was never 
            really that good, always beaten out by those graceful types, more talented or dedicated, but still it was fun for a hobby I guess"
            .
            -"Was that class a fond memory of yours?"
            .
            "Heh, yeah it was a nice time, made a few friends, but the more I grew up the more muscle I put on, and the less viable it became for a job, 
            so I settled down here I guess."
            .
            -"From what I hear there are still a handful of private tutors on Earth, we could give you some vacation time and you could
            apply try it out once more?"
            .
            "Heh... I appriciate the offer, I really do, but just talking to you is enough to make me feel better bout it."
            . 
            "I do kinda regret not becoming a fencer but I think i've come to terms that it was never more than just a Dream"
            .
            .
            .
            "Just a childish dream."
